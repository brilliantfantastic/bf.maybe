====================

The way too public site for the fantastical Brilliant Fantastic.

## Who?

I pity the fool who don't know who Brilliant Fantastic is.

BF is a development shop in the sprawling metroplois of Toledo, OH. Currently made up of one (uno) handsome person, I design and develop web applications for the non-fools.

## What?

I use a tool. That tool is called Ruby. It is a great tool. I am good at using that tool.

I also use a tool called Javascript. I am pretty good with that tool as well. The jury is still out on whether I like that tool.
